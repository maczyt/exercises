These are some basic (and advanced) coding challenges

Here's the basic workflow:

```shell
[~]         $ git clone https://github.com/kolodny/exercises
[~]         $ cd exercises
[exercises] $ npm install
[exercises] $ cd debounce
[debounce]  $ vi index.js
[debounce]  $ npm test
```

This uses a basic TDD approach so take a look at the test.js file in each directory to see what needs to be implemented, write an index.js as the solution file

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome, please follow the basic workflow:

1. Make a folder
2. Copy a package.json from a sibling folder
3. Make a test.js file
4. Optionally provide a README.md

## Exericse

1. ~~async~~
2. ~~binary-search~~
3. ~~curry~~
4. ~~debounce~~
5. ~~flatten~~
6. ~~flatten-thunk~~
7. ~~invert-tree~~
8. jasmine-async
9. ~~map~~
10. ~~memoize~~
11. merkle
12. ~~middleware~~
13. morse-code
14. ~~once~~
15. ~~sort~~
16. ~~throttle~~
17. throttle-promises
18. ~~update~~
19. ~~value~~

> 现在只剩`jasmine-async`/`merkle`/`morse-code`/`throttle-promise`, 我对这些不是很感兴趣，所以 exercise 就做到此为止，有更好的解决方法可以私信我
